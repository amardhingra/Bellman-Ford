The protocol that I have chosen to use for sending data in my UDP packets 
has the sender send a list of all the nodes it can reach with their associated
distances. It sends each node it can reach on a new line in the following
format:

NodeIPAddress:NodePort/Distance

The first line will always contain the senders IP address and port number with
the distance equal to cost of the direct path between them. Sending the hard wired
distance between the two nodes allows them to dynamically change the distance
if one of the nodes knows that the cost of the link is now lower
